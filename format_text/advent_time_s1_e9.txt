Jake: Pussy cat! Come here!
Jake: Hey!
Jake: Help!
Finn: Don't worry! His spells never last long.
Jake: Who are these guys? This is a great fight!
Finn: Yeah! You never fought them? They come out every day at four o’clock on the dot.
Jake: I guess that's because I meet Lady Rainicorn every day at four o'clock on the dot. Oh shoot! I'm late!
Finn: You should stay, man. At five o'clock every day, I chop both their heads off, and they grow them back for the next day.
Jake: Aw, man, that sounds awesome! I do want to stay and fight those guys, but I also want to hang out with my girlfriend.
Finn: Boo!
Jake:  Finn
Jake:  Oh!
Jake: Sorry! Sorry I'm late. Finn and I were fighting this shark and science cat, and I lost track of time. Anyway, I’m here now, M'lady, and I have brought to you half an orange.
Lady Rainicorn: Ooh! 고마워!  
Jake: Nice! Now make that green! 
Jake:  Ha ha ha! Yeah, that's good.
Lady Rainicorn:  자러 가야겠다. 
Jake: Sleep! But we were supposed to play viola together!
Lady Rainicorn: 미안해. 
Jake:  Yeah. Sorry again for coming so late.
Lady Rainicorn: 잘 자.  Jake
Shelby:  Hi Jake.
Jake: Oh, hey, Shelby.
Shelby: Why you looking so down in the dumps?
Shelby: No response, huh? Guess you're good.
Jake: I'm fed up, Shelby!
Shelby: Hmm?
Jake: Whenever I hang out with Lady Rainicorn, I miss out on fun times with Finn.
Jake: And then when I hang out with Finn, I'm missin' out on Lady Rainicorn!  Oh!
Shelby:  Hey, Jake, why don't you just hang out with both of them at the same time?
Jake:  And then I won't miss anything! Shelby! My problems are solved.
Jake: Ah, isn't this great? This is totally great.  Isn't it?
Finn: Yeah.
Jake:  Isn't it?
Lady Rainicorn: 맞아.  
Finn:  What? What did she say?
Jake: She said she also thinks it's great.
Finn: Oh.
Jake: Yeah.
Jake: Hmm...  Hey, did you know that you both have an awesome sense of humor?
Finn: We do?
Jake: Yeah! Anybody have a joke?
Finn: Oh, I have a joke!  okay. Knock knock.
Lady Rainicorn: 누구세요 
Jake: She said, "who's there?"
Finn: Diarrhea!
Jake: 쟤가 설사래. 
Lady Rainicorn: 어, 나도 들었어. 뭐야, 하나도 재미없잖아.  
Finn: Did she say diarrhea who?
Jake: Uh, no. No, she didn't say, "diarrhea who?" She didn't... say it. Lady, how 'bout you tell a joke?
Lady Rainicorn: 글쎄.. 뭐가 있었을까? 아! 우리 완전히 다 벗고 상추밭 미친듯이 뛰어다닌 거 기억 나?  That farmer got crazy mad!")
Finn: What's the joke?
Jake: Uhh... well, the joke doesn’t translate very well.
Finn: Man, I- I might leave. Is it okay if I leave? I kind of want to go fight something.
Jake: Noooo! Don’t leave.  Oh, dude! I just remembered! There's a universal translator device at the bottom of Lake Szelezon!
Finn: The lake guarded by evil Lake Knights?
Jake: Yeah, I can't remember why I threw it in there. Let's all go and get it!
Finn: Whoa  Jake! You’re inviting Rainicorn? No offense, but isn't she a little too sweet for deadly adventure?
Jake: Trust me, Finn, she’s the Rowdy Queen. She can do anything!
Finn: Hmmm. Alright! Trust pound!
Finn: Underwater camouflage!
Finn: Lady! You are incredible! You should adventure with us all the time!
Jake:  All according to plan.
Lady: 고마워, 나도 재밌었어. 
Finn: Uhhh, what?
Jake:  Try sayin' something toots!
Lady: ... and then I ate all the peaches in the orchard, and that farmer was sooo angry!
Finn:  I like this voice!
Lady: 
Lady: ...and that's the end of my story.
Jake:  Well, at least with old man option we can understand him, I MEAN HER! I mean you sugar!
Lady: Hop on my back and I'll give you a ride home!
Finn:  Hai-yah!
Lady: Come on my darling. Wrap your legs around me.
Jake:  I remember why I drowned that translator now.
Finn: Hey grandpa, how are you able to fly if you don't have wings?
Lady: Well, light travels from the sun. Then bounces off of our planet and then back into our eyes so we can perceive color.
Jake: Whoa! 
Lady: My body can intercept that light and dance around on it. 
Jake: Lady! It's a little rocky in the back seat here!
Finn:  That forest wizard is giving away free power rings!
Lady: Do you wanna try gettin' some Finn?
Finn: Yeahs! 
Jake: 
Finn:  Whoa! Did you see that!? This is like the funnest thing ever!
Jake:  Where were you guys?
Finn: Wait a minute, you didn't fly down with us?
Lady: We thought you were behind us the whole time!
Jake: Noooo!  I was shouting your name!
Lady:  Ooh! Honey pot, we probably couldn't here you because of the cloud density.
Finn: Jake! Check out these power rings! 
Jake: Whoa. That's cool! You got ten of them?
Finn: Yeah! Lady got some too.
Jake:  Oh, that’s cool.
Finn: Uh, You want one of mine? I’ve got so many.
Jake: Yeah! Thanks man!
Finn: Oh. Wait, I can't take them off. I guess they're cursed.  Still pretty cool though.
Jake: Yeah, they're awesome. 
Finn:  Alright this time I’m gonna destroy you Rainicorn!
Lady: Oh, okay.  That sounds nice.
Finn: Oh I got the sword!
Jake: Hey, Lady, you wanna go play music together or somethin'?
Lady: Oh, oh. Uh, I would, but I-I'm in the middle of this game.
Jake: Oh.  Hey Finn. After this next game do you wanna go adventurin' with me?
Finn: Lady and I are going to a party in the Cloud Kingdom tonight.  You should go to that with us.
Jake: Humph! Humph Humph Humph! 
Finn: Jake stop sighing you're messing up my game!  What’s goin' on with you!
Jake: Mmmm, Nothin'!
Finn: Awww dang it! Man, Lady, you’re too good at this! Hey, It's time to party with clouds! Jake, you comin'?
Jake: No!
Finn:  Dude, I thought you wanted to spend more time with me and Lady together?
Jake: I do. 
Finn: Then come on.
Jake: No YOU go ahead!  And YOU have fun with MY girlfriend!
Finn: Uhhh... 
Jake: 
Jake: 
Cloud man: Hello Cloud Kingdom.
Jake: Uh, yes, hello. Um, I’m lookin' for Finn the Human and Lady Rainicorn.  Hello, can you hear me? Hello.
Cloud man: Yeah, they left a while ago.
Jake: A while ago?!
Jake: 
Finn:  Wow Lady! Hanging out with you it the best!
Lady: I like you too Finn.
Jake: Nooo 
Finn:  Hey, where’s that music coming from?
Jake:  Yeah, yeah, louder.
Lady:  Jake what are you doing?
Jake: Oh, hey guys. I'm just sharing a tender moment with my beautiful friend Tiffany.
Finn: Stop! You're making Lady jealous!
Jake: Well I’m trying to make you both jealous!
Finn:  Why would I be jealous of Tiffany?
Jake: Becaaause, Tiffany's a boy! 
Tiffany:  Jake's MY best friend now! FOREVER!
Finn: 
Lady: Jake, what's going on with you?
Jake:  I guess I'm just jealous of how much you and Finn like each other.
Lady: I'm hanging out with Finn because you wanted us to get to know each other better.
Jake: I know. Gaah.
Finn: 
Tiffany:  No! Jake will be mine!
Jake: I'm sorry I'm an idiot baby. Forgive me?
Lady: Oh sweet potato, I love you BECAUSE you're an idiot. You make me feel like a genius!
