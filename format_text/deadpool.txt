DEADPOOL: Kinda lonesome back here.
DEADPOOL: Little help?
DOPINDER: Sir, I have to keep my hands on the wheel.
DEADPOOL: Excuse me.
DOPINDER: Dopinder.
DEADPOOL: Pool. Dead.
DEADPOOL: Mmm. Nice.
DOPINDER: Smells good, no?
DEADPOOL: Not the Daffodil Daydream. The girl.
DOPINDER: Ah, yes. Gita. She is quite lovely. She would have made me a very agreeable wife, but, um… Gita’s heart has been stolen by my cousin Bantu. He is as dishonorable as he is attractive.
DEADPOOL: Dopinder, I’m starting to think there’s a reason I’m in this cab today.
DOPINDER: Yes, sir, you called for it, remember?
DEADPOOL: No, my slender, brown friend. Love is a beautiful thing. When you find it, the whole world tastes like Daffodil Daydream.
DOPINDER: Mmm.
DEADPOOL: So you gotta hold onto love. Tight!
DEADPOOL: And never let go. Don’t make the same mistakes I did. Got it?
DOPINDER: Yes.
DEADPOOL: Or else the whole world tastes like Mama June after hot yoga.
DOPINDER: Sir, what does Miss Mama June taste like?
DEADPOOL: Like two hobos fucking in a shoe filled with piss.
DOPINDER: Okay, stop.
DEADPOOL: I can go all day, Dopinder. The point is, it’s bad.
DOPINDER: It’s bad. Uh, why the fancy red suit Mr. Pool?
DEADPOOL: Oh, that’s because it’s Christmas Day, Dopinder. And I’m after someone on my naughty list. I’ve been waiting one year, three weeks, six days, and oh…
DEADPOOL: Fourteen minutes to make him fix what he did to me.
DOPINDER: And what did he do to you?
DEADPOOL: This shit.
DEADPOOL: Boo!
FRANCIS: They won’t disappoint.
MAN: They better not. What about next month’s shipment?
FRANCIS: There won’t be one. You’re not the only one with a war to win.
MAN: That won’t do.
FRANCIS: See, we’ve had this small disruption to our supply chain.
FRANCIS: We’d appreciate your patience.
MAN: Okay!
FRANCIS: We’ll deliver in full the following month.
FRANCIS: Pleasure doing business with you.
MAN: Fucking mutant.
DEADPOOL: Aw, shit! I forgot my ammo bag!
DOPINDER: Shall we turn back?
DEADPOOL: Nope, no time. Fuck it. I got this. Nine, ten, eleven, twelve bullets, or bust. We’re here!
DOPINDER: That’s uh, twenty seven fifty.
DEADPOOL: I, I never carry a wallet while I’m working. Ruins the lines of my suit.
DOPINDER: Oh.
DEADPOOL: But, uh, how ‘bout a crisp high-five!
DOPINDER: Okay.
DEADPOOL: Merry Christmas.
DOPINDER: And a convival Tuesday in April to you too, Mr. Pool!
DEADPOOL: Wha- Oh! Oh, hello. I know, right? Who’s balls did I have to fondle to get my very own movie? I can’t tell you, but it does rhyme with Pullverine. And let me tell you;  he’s got a nice pair of smooth criminals down under. Anyway, I got places to be, a face to fix, and - oh! Bad guys to kill.
DEADPOOL: Maximum effort.
DEADPOOL: Rich, corinthian leather.
DEADPOOL: I’m looking for Francis. Have you seen this man?
DEADPOOL: I’ve never said this, but don’t swallow.
DEADPOOL: Shit. Did I leave the stove on?
REPORTER: Now, breaking news: A multi car collision turns shots fired on the crosstown expressway this morning. Gridlock has kept police from the scene.
REPORTER: Residents are advised to remain in their homes the assailant appears to be armed, dangerous, and wearing a red suit.
COLOSSUS: Red suit.
COLOSSUS: Deadpool. Negasonic! Come. We have mission.
NEGASONIC: Colossus, wait up.
COLOSSUS: I’ve given Deadpool every chance to join us. But he’d rather act like a child. A heavily armed child. When will he grow up and see benefits of becoming X-man?
NEGASONIC: Which benefits, the matching unitards? The house that blows up every few years?
COLOSSUS: Please. House blowing up builds character. You ate breakfast, yes? Breakfast is most important meal of day. Here. Protein bar. Good for bones.
COLOSSUS: Deadpool may try to break yours.
DEADPOOL: Hey! Oh!
DEADPOOL: Wait! You may be wondering, why the red suit? Well, that’s so bad guys can’t see me bleed. This guy’s got the right idea.
DEADPOOL: He wore the brown pants.
DEADPOOL: Fine! I only have twelve bullets, so you’re going to have to share. Let’s count ‘em down.
DEADPOOL: Shit.
DEADPOOL: Mother fucker! Ten. . Shit fuck!
DEADPOOL: Bad Deadpool.
DEADPOOL: Seven. Good Deadpool.
DEADPOOL: Someone’s not counting.
DEADPOOL: Six.
DEADPOOL: Four.
DEADPOOL: Ah! Right up main street.
DEADPOOL: Ooh. I’m touching myself tonight.
DEADPOOL: Francis! Francis!
DEADPOOL: What the shit biscuit! Where you at, Francis?
DEADPOOL: Ugh. You’re not Francis.
DEADPOOL: Really? Rolling up the sleeves?
DEADPOOL:  You’re probably thinking, ‘My boyfriend said this was a superhero movie, but this guy in the red suit just turned that other guy into a fucking kebab.’ Well, I may be super, but I am no hero. And yeah, technically, this is a murder. But some of the best love stories start with a murder. And that’s exactly what this is. A love story. And to tell it right, I gotta take you back to way before I squeezed this ass into red spandex.
MERCHANT: Look, what if I slow it down for you? I didn’t order the pizza.
JEREMY: Is this 7348 Red Ledge Drive? Are you Mr. Merchant?
MERCHANT: Yeah, the Mr. Merchant, who didn’t order the fucking pie!
JEREMY: Then who placed the call?
DEADPOOL: I did. Pineapple and olive? Sweet and salty.
MERCHANT: Fuck are you? The fuck you doing in my crib?
DEADPOOL: Is it bread crust?
JEREMY: Oh, God, I hope not.
MERCHANT: Woah, man, look. If this is about that poker game, I told him, I told Howie that uh… Just uh, just take whatever you want.
DEADPOOL: Thanks.
JEREMY: Sir, before you do anything to him, mind if I get a big tip?
DEADPOOL: Jeremy, is it? Wade Wilson. That is ah, a no go on the tiperoo, Jer. I’m not here for him. I’m here for you.
MERCHANT: Oh, hey, wow, dodged a big time bullet on that one!
DEADPOOL: You’re not out of the woods yet. You need to seriously ease-up on the bedazzling. They’re jeans, not a chandelier. P.S., I am keeping your wallet. You did kind of give it to me.
MERCHANT: Hey, look man, can I just have my Sam’s Card -
DEADPOOL: I will shoot your fucking cat.
MERCHANT: I don’t even know what that means. I don’t have a cat.
DEADPOOL: Then who’s kitty litter did I just shit in?
DEADPOOL: Anywho, tell me something, what situation isn’t improved by pizza? Do you happen to know a Megan, Orflowsky? Orlavsky? Orlovsky? Am I getting that right?
DEADPOOL: Good.
DEADPOOL: Cause she knows you. Jeremy, I belong to a group of guys who take a dime to beat a fella down.
DEADPOOL: And Megan, she’s not made of money, but lucky for her, I got a soft spot.
JEREMY: I’m, uh…
DEADPOOL: A stalker. Threats hurt, Jer. But not nearly as much as serrated steel. So keep away from Megan. Cool?
JEREMY: Yes, sir.
DEADPOOL: Kay, we’re cool.
JEREMY: Wait, we are?
DEADPOOL: Yeah, totally done.
DEADPOOL: You should have seen your face!
MERCHANT: I didn’t know what to do. I was so scared.
DEADPOOL: Soft spot, remember?
DEADPOOL: Read a book in her general direction again, and you will learn in the worst of ways that I have some hard spots too. That came out wrong. Or did it?
DEADPOOL: Megan.
DEADPOOL: You’ve heard the last of Jeremy. He’s sorry.
MEGAN: No friggin’ way!
DEADPOOL: Shoulda brought my roller blades, show these kids how it’s done.
DEADPOOL: And that’s why we do it. But mostly the money.
GIRL: Think you could fuck up my step-dad?
DEADPOOL: If I give a guy a pavement facial, it’s cause he’s earned it.
MEGAN: Hey, wait! You’re my hero.
DEADPOOL: No, no, no, no, no. That I ain't.
DEADPOOL:  Nope. Never will be.
MAN: Fuck you, Wade.
DEADPOOL:  I’m just a bad guy who gets paid to fuck-up worse guys.
DEADPOOL:  Welcome to Sister Margaret’s. It’s like a job fair for mercenaries. Think of us like really fucked up tooth fairies, except we knock out the teeth and take the cash. You best hope we never see your name on a gold card.
WEASEL: Wade Wilson. Patron saint of the pitiful What can I do for you?
DEADPOOL: I’d love a blowjob.
WEASEL: Oh God, me too.
DEADPOOL: The drink, moose knuckle. But first…
DEADPOOL: And I ain’t taking any babysitting money, alright? Make sure that gets back to Miss, uh…
WEASEL: Orlovsky?
DEADPOOL: Her.
WEASEL: You sure?
DEADPOOL: Mhm.
WEASEL: You know, for a merc, you’re pretty warm-blooded. I bet you let the kid of easy, too.
DEADPOOL: Oh, he’s not a bad kid, he’s… Just a little light stalking. I was way worse than him when I was his age. I was traveling to exotic places. Baghdad, Mogadishu, Jacksonville. Meeting new and exciting people.
WEASEL: And killing them, yeah. I’ve seen your instagram. So what was special forces doing in Jacksonville?
DEADPOOL: That’s classified. They have wonderful T.G.I. Friday’s.
WEASEL: Alright, Kalua, Bailey’s, and whipped cream. I give you: A Blowjob. Ah, why did you make me make that?
DEADPOOL: Kelly, Kelly, Kelly, Kelly. Could you bring that over to Bob, please? And tell him it’s from Buck.
WEASEL: Remind me what good will come of this?
DEADPOOL: I don’t take the shits, I just disturb them.
DEADPOOL: Cheers. To your health.
WEASEL: Fuck you.
WEASEL: That’s a new stool
MERC: Stay the fuck down.
WEASEL: Alright, move. Move, move, move, move.
WEASEL: Yup. Still breathing.
WEASEL: Nobody wins today. Nice try, Wade.
DEADPOOL: You got me. I picked Boothe in the dead pool. Who’d you pick?
WEASEL: You know, Wade, uh, um…
DEADPOOL: No… You did not bet on me to die.
DEADPOOL: You bet on me to die. Wow. Mother fucker, you’re the world’s worst friend. But joke’s on you. I’m living to 102, and then moving to the city of Detroit.
WEASEL: I’m sorry, I just wanted to win money. I never win anything.
DEADPOOL: Oh, whatever. Soldiers of fortune, drinks on me!
WEASEL: Domestic! Nothing imported.
VANESSA: Woah, woah, woah, woah, baby. You sure you wanna shoot your full wad?
DEADPOOL: Uh… Tight.
VANESSA: Vanessa.
DEADPOOL: Wade. What’s a nice place like you doing in a girl like this?
MERC: I’d hit that.
DEADPOOL: You’d best apologize, before…
DEADPOOL: … Yeah. That.
VANESSA: Say the magic words, fat Gandalf.
MERC: I’m sorry.
DEADPOOL: Breath through the nose
MERC: I don’t have a filter between my brain and my-
DEADPOOL: Hey, woah, hakuna his tatas! He’s sorry. Get out of here, go. Go cast a spell.
VANESSA: Hey, hands off the merchandise.
DEADPOOL: Merchandise, oh. So you uh… Warm fuzzys for money?
VANESSA: Yep.
DEADPOOL: Rough childhood?
VANESSA: Rougher than yours. Daddy left before I was born.
DEADPOOL: Daddy left before I was conceived.
VANESSA: Ever had a cigarette put out on your skin?
DEADPOOL: Where else do you put one out?
VANESSA: I was molested.
DEADPOOL: Me too. Uncle.
VANESSA: Uncles. They took turns.
DEADPOOL: I watched my own birthday party through the keyhole of a locked closet, which also happens to be -
VANESSA: Your bedroom. Lucky. I slept in a dishwasher box.
DEADPOOL: You had a dishwasher! I didn’t even go to sleep. It was pretty much 24/7 ball gags, brownie mix and clown porn.
VANESSA: Who would do such a thing?
DEADPOOL: Hopefully you. Later tonight? Hey, what… What can I get for, uh… $275 and a yogurt lite rewards card?
VANESSA: Maybe about forty-eight minutes of whatever the fuck you want.
WEASEL: Did she just put a gift card in your mouth?
DEADPOOL: It’s time to put balls in holes. You said whatever I want.
VANESSA: I get it.
VANESSA: You love skeeball. Apparently more than you love vagina.
DEADPOOL: It’s a tough call. I just want to get to know the real you. Not the short, 2-dimensional sex object peddled by Hollywood.
VANESSA: Balls in holes.
DEADPOOL: Balls in holes. Prepare to lose tragically.
VANESSA: Bring it, big man.
DEADPOOL: Okay.
VANESSA: Ruh-roh.
DEADPOOL: Ruh-roh.
DEADPOOL: A limited edition, Voltron: Defender of the Universe ring, por favor. I’ve had my eye on this sucker for a while.
VANESSA: And I will take the pencil eraser.
DEADPOOL: M’lady?
VANESSA: Well, I hate to break it to you, but your 48 minutes are up.
DEADPOOL: Hey, how many more minutes could I get for this? FYI, five mini-lion bots come together to form one super-lion bot.
VANESSA:  Five mini-lion bots? Three minutes.
DEADPOOL: What do we do with the remaining two minutes, thirty seven seconds?
VANESSA: Cuddle?
VANESSA: How long can you keep this up?
DEADPOOL: All year?
VANESSA: Happy Valentine’s Day.
DEADPOOL: Happy Chinese New Year.
VANESSA: Year of the Dog.
VANESSA: Relax. And happy International Women’s Day.
DEADPOOL: Ah! Nope, nope, nope.
DEADPOOL: Happy Lent.
VANESSA: Ow, Wade!
DEADPOOL: Happy Halloween.
DEADPOOL: Happy Halloween.
VANESSA: Happy Thanksgiving.
DEADPOOL: I love you.
DEADPOOL: If your left leg is Thanksgiving and your right leg is Christmas, can I visit you between the holidays?
DEADPOOL: Ugh, that sweater is terrible! But, it looks good on you.
VANESSA: Red’s your color. Brings out the bloodshot in your eyes.
DEADPOOL: Listen, I’ve been thinking.
VANESSA: Really?
DEADPOOL: About why we’re so good together.
VANESSA: Why’s that?
DEADPOOL: Well, your crazy matches my crazy. And we’re like two jigsaw pieces, you know? Um… Weird, curvy edges.
VANESSA: Put them together and you can see the picture on top. Wade, there’s something I’ve been meaning to ask you, but only because you haven’t gotten around to asking me. Will you, um… Stick it it my -
DEADPOOL: Marry me?
VANESSA: Uhh... Jinx? Where were you hiding that?
DEADPOOL: Nowhere. I spent one month’s salary, so…
VANESSA: You mean it?
DEADPOOL: I do.
VANESSA: That’s my line.
VANESSA: I love you, Wade Wilson.
DEADPOOL: So that’s a… You’re s’posed to -
VANESSA: Yes!
DEADPOOL: Yes! Ha ha ha! I feel just like a little girl!
DEADPOOL: What if I just held on and never let go?
VANESSA: Ride a bitch’s back like Yoda on Luke?
DEADPOOL: Oh, Star Wars jokes…
VANESSA: Empire.
DEADPOOL: Jesus Christ, it’s like I made you in a computer.
DEADPOOL: Hey. Perfect. Pee break. Shake it, yeah.
DEADPOOL:  Here’s the thing. Life is an endless series of trainwrecks with only brief commercial like breaks of happiness. This had been the ultimate commercial break.
DEADPOOL:  Which meant it was time to return to our regularly scheduled program.
VANESSA: Oh, my God! Wade!
DEADPOOL: You’re clowning. You’re not clowning? I sense clowns.
DOCTOR: People react to news of late-stage cancer differently. There are certainly options we can look into. Drugs are being developed every day.
VANESSA: So what do we do? Surely there must be something we can do. My uncle Ivan was diagnosed with thyroid cancer and all these new experimental drugs…
DEADPOOL:  Vanessa’s already working on plan A, B, all the way through Z. Me? I’m memorizing the details of her face. Like it’s the first time I’m seeing it. Or the last.
DOCTOR: Mr. Wilson. Mr Wilson? Take your time to process this. It’s important not to do anything rash.
DEADPOOL: Now, if I were a two-hundred pound sack of assholes named Francis, where would I hide? Oh.
DEADPOOL: A hush falls over the crowd. Rookie sensation Wade W. Wilson out of Regina, Saskatchewan lines up the shot. His form looks good.
DEADPOOL: And that's why Regina rhymes with fun. Ladies and gentlemen, what you're witnessing is sweet, dick-kicking revenge.
DEADPOOL: Oh! Giving him the business.
DEADPOOL: Incoming!
DEADPOOL: This is taking unsportsmanlike conduct to a whole new level!
DEADPOOL: Looking good, Francis. Well rested. Like you've been pitching, not catching. Ringing any bells? No?
DEADPOOL: How about now?
FRANCIS: Huh. Wade fucking Wilson. Well hello, gorgeous.
DEADPOOL: Yeah, like I got bit by a radioactive Sharpei. Yeah, and whose fault is that, Francis? Time to undo what you did to this butterface.
FRANCIS: You should thank me. Apparently I made you immortal. I'm actually quite jealous.
DEADPOOL: Yeah, but this ain't a life worth living, is it? Now, I'm about to do to you what Limp Bizkit did to music in the late '90s.
DEADPOOL: Dad?
DEADPOOL:  I think we can all agree that shit just went sideways in the most colossal way.
DEADPOOL:  Well, maybe not the most.
DEADPOOL: Now this is my most prized possession.
VANESSA: Wham?
DEADPOOL: No, no, no, no. Wham! Make It Big is the album that George and Andy earned the exclamation point.
VANESSA: So, am I supposed to just smile and wave you out the door?
DEADPOOL: Think of it like spring cleaning. Only, if spring was death. God, if I had a nickel for every time I spanked it to Bernadette Peters.
VANESSA: Sounds like you do. Bernadette is not going anywhere, because you're not going anywhere! Drink.
DEADPOOL: You're right. Cancer's only in my liver, lungs, prostate, and brain. All things I can live without.
VANESSA: You belong here at home. Surrounded by your Ultron, and your Bernadette, and your me.
DEADPOOL: Listen, we both know that cancer is a shitshow. Like, Yakoff Smirnoff opening for the Spin Doctors at the Iowa State Fair, shitshow. And under no circumstances will I take you to that show. I want you to remember me. Not the ghost of Christmas me.
VANESSA: Well, I want to remember us!
DEADPOOL: I swear to God, I'm gonna find you in the next life, and I'm gonna boombox Careless Whisper outside your window. Wham!
VANESSA: No one is boomboxing shit, okay?
VANESSA: We can fight this. Besides, I just realized something. You win. Your life is officially way more fucked up than mine.
DEADPOOL: I love you.
WEASEL: Wade.
DEADPOOL: Wease.
WEASEL: You look like you need a blowjob and a shower. Courtesy calls for the latter first.
DEADPOOL: Yeah, how about three shots of Patron?
WEASEL: Yeah, how about Triticum aestivum? Wheat grass. Excellent for the immune system.
DEADPOOL: Jesus Christ, you sound like Vanessa. Here, check it out. She's sending away for all these colorful clinic brochures.
DEADPOOL: I'm sure they're all FDA approved. Chechnya. Isn't that where you go to get cancer? We've got China, and central Mexico. You know how they say cancer in spanish?
WEASEL: How?
DEADPOOL: El cancer.
WEASEL: Oh. I could have guessed that. Look how happy you look here?
WEASEL: Mind if I keep this? Put it up, so I can remember? When you looked alive. At least now I'm gonna win the dead pool, now that you're gonna die tragically of cancer.
DEADPOOL: Thanks.
WEASEL: Oh, and that guy over there came in looking for you.
WEASEL: Real grim reaper type. I dunno. Might further the plot.
MAN: Ah! Mr. Wilson.
DEADPOOL: How can I help you? Besides luring children into a panel van.
MAN: I understand you've recently been diagnosed with terminal cancer.
DEADPOOL: Stalker alert.
MAN: My job. Recruitment. I'm sorry you've had such a tough go. But you're a fighter. Special forces, forty-one confirmed kills.
DEADPOOL: One every seven weeks. At that rate, most folks get a haircut.
DEADPOOL: It's to wash the taste out. Of being so... impressive.
MAN: And now you spend your days sticking up for the little people.
DEADPOOL: People change. What do you want?
MAN: I represent an organization of people that may be able to help. What if I told you we can cure your cancer? And what's more, give you abilities most men only dream of.
DEADPOOL: I'd say that you sound like an infomercial. But not a good one, like Slapchop, more Shakeweighty.
MAN: The world needs extraordinary soldiers. We won't just make you better. We will make you better than better. A superhero.
DEADPOOL: Look, Agent Smith. I tried the superhero business and it left a mark. But if I ever hit, 'Fuck it', I'll hit you up. Oh, uh, shit. We're within 500 yards of a school, so you may wanna... You know. Yeah.
DEADPOOL: His drinks on him.
VANESSA: Hey, what's going on?
DEADPOOL: Hey, sorry. I had a Liam Neeson nightmare. I dreamt I kidnapped his daughter and he just wasn't having it.
DEADPOOL: Hey, uh, they made three of those movies. At some point you have to wonder if he's just a bad parent.
DEADPOOL:  The worst part about cancer isn't what it does to you. But what it does to the people you love. Who knew if this guy could save my life. But I knew there was only one way I could save hers.
DEADPOOL:  Isn't that what superheroes do?
DEADPOOL: Okay. Let's pro-con this superhero thing. Pro: they pull down a gaggle of ass. Dry cleaning-discounts, lucrative film deals both origin stories and larger ensemble team movies. Con: They're all lame-ass teacher's pets.
COLOSSUS: You know I can hear you.
DEADPOOL: I'm not talking to you. I was talking to them.
COLOSSUS:  Stay right here. You've been warned before, Deadpool. This is a shameful and reckless use of your powers. You will both be coming with us.
DEADPOOL: Look, Colossus! I don't have time for the goody-two-shoes bullshit right now! And... you are?
NEGASONIC: Negasonic Teenage Warhead.
DEADPOOL: Negasonic Teenage... What the shit? That's the coolest name ever! So what, you're like his sidekick?
COLOSSUS: No, trainee.
DEADPOOL: Let me guess. X-men left you behind on, what, shit detail?
NEGASONIC: What does that make you?
DEADPOOL: Pretending you're not here, Negasonic Teenage Warhead. Trade names?
NEGASONIC: Can we go?
DEADPOOL: Look! I'm a teenage girl! I'd rather be anywhere than here. I'm all about long, sullen silences, followed by mean comments, followed by more silences. So what's it gonna be, huh? Long sullen silence, or mean comment? Go on.
NEGASONIC: You've got me in a box here.
DEADPOOL: Ah-hah!
COLOSSUS: We can't allow this Deadpool. Please, come quietly.
DEADPOOL: You big, chrome, cock-gobbler!
COLOSSUS: That's not nice.
DEADPOOL: You're really gonna fuck this up for me? Trust me. That wheezing bag of dick tips has it coming! He's pure evil! Besides, nobody's getting hurt!
DEADPOOL: That guy was already up there when I got here.
COLOSSUS: Wade, you're better than this! Join us! Use your powers for good.
DEADPOOL: Heads up.
COLOSSUS: Be a superhero!
DEADPOOL: Listen, the day I decide to become a crime-fighting shit-swizzler, who rooms with a bunch of other little whiners, at the Neverland mansion of some creepy, old, bald, Heaven's Gate-looking mother fucker, on that day... I'll send your shiny happy ass a friend request. But until then, I'm gonna do what I came here to do. Either that, or slap the bitch out of you.
COLOSSUS: Wade...
NEGASONIC: Hey -
DEAPOOL: Zip it, Sinead!
NEGASONIC: Hey, douchepool!
DEADPOOL: And I hope you're watching!
COLOSSUS: Quite unfortunate.
DEADPOOL: That does it!
DEADPOOL: Oh, Canada! That's not good.
COLOSSUS: Wade, please.
DEADPOOL: Cock shot!
DEADPOOL: Oh, your poor wife!
COLOSSUS: You really should stop.
DEADPOOL: All the dinosaurs feared the T-rex.
DEADPOOL: Ah! I promise this gets worse for you, big boy!
COLOSSUS: This is embarrassing. Please, stay down.
DEADPOOL: You ever hear of the one-legged man in the ass-kicking contest?
COLOSSUS: Do you have off switch?
DEADPOOL: Yeah, it's right next to the prostate. Or is that the on switch?
COLOSSUS: Enough!
COLOSSUS: Let us go talk to the professor.
DEADPOOL: McAvoy or Stewart? These timelines are so confusing. Dead or alive you're coming with me!
COLOSSUS: You will recover, Wade. You always do.
DEADPOOL:  You ever see 127 Hours? Spoiler alert.
NEGASONIC: Oh, my God. Nasty.
DEADPOOL: Oh, there's the money shot, baby! Are you there, God? It's me, Margaret.
DEADPOOL: Rock, meet Bottom. When life ends up breath-takingly fucked, you can generally trace it back to one big, bad decision.
DEADPOOL:  The one that sent you down the road to shittsburgh. This, well, this was mine.
MAN: Mr. Wilson, nothing warms my heart more than a change of someone else's. You finally hit, 'Fuck it'.
DEADPOOL: Just promise me you'll do right by me. So I can do right by someone else.
MAN: Of course.
DEADPOOL: And please don't make the super suit green. Or animated!
DEADPOOL: This place seems sanitary. My first request is warmer hands.
DEADPOOL: And, Jesus, a warmer table! You should really come up with a safe word fellas. I'm thinking pork and beans.
DEADPOOL: Aren't you a little strong for a lady? I'm calling wang. What's up with the matches? Oral fixation? Or just a big Stallone fan?
FRANCIS: Patience, Angel.
FRANCIS: All in good time.
DEADPOOL: Are you here for the turn down service or what?
FRANCIS: We have another talker.
DEADPOOL: I'm just excited about my first day at super hero camp.
ANGEL: Shut the fuck up.
FRANCIS: Mr. Wilson, my name's Ajax. I manage this workshop. My welcome speech used to be filled with euphemisms like, 'This may hurt a little'. 'This may cause you some discomfort'. But I've grown blunt. This workshop is not a government led program. It's a private institution that turns reclamation projects like yourself into men of extraordinary abilities. But if you think super human powers are acquired painlessly, well... I'm injecting with a serum that activates any mutant genes lurking in your DNA. For it to work we need to subject you to extreme stress.
FRANCIS: You've heard the whole, make an omelette break some eggs thing, right? I'm about to hurt you, Wade. I was a patient here once myself, you know. The treatment affects everyone differently. It made Angel inhumanly strong. In my case, it enhanced my reflexes, and scorched my nerve endings so I not longer feel pain. And in fact, I no longer feel anything.
DEADPOOL: Thank you! Thank you. You have something in your teeth. Just in the middle there. Romaine lettuce, or something. It's been bothering me for a long time.
DEADPOOL: Ha! Made you look. Hey, is Ajax your actual name? Because it sounds suspiciously made up. What is it really? Kevin? Ruth? Scott? Mitch? Dexter? Is it Basil Fawlty?
FRANCIS: Joke away. The one thing that never survives this place is a sense of humor.
DEADPOOL: We'll see about that.
FRANCIS: I suppose we will. He's all yours.
DEADPOOL: Oh, come on. You're going to leave me all alone here with less angry Rosie O'Donnell?
FRANCIS: This is how it's going to work. Adrenaline acts as a catalyst for the serum, so we're going to have to make you suffer. If you're lucky, your mutant genes will activate and manifest in spectacular fashion. If not, well, we'll have to keep hurting you. In new and more painful ways, each more different than the last. Until you finally mutate. Or die.
DEADPOOL: Got a bucket list? I'd really like to light a spliff off of the Olympic Torch.
CUNNINGHAM: Pass it to me right after.
DEADPOOL: Let's not forget naked tandem base jumping with the WNBA Sacramento Monarchs.
CUNNINGHAM: Anything on my bucket list would involve public nudity.
DEADPOOL: Giving Meredith Baxter Birney a dutch oven.
CUNNINGHAM: No, receiving a dutch oven from Meredith Baxter Birney. Making banana pancakes for my kids.
DEADPOOL: Vanessa. I wanna see Vanessa.
FRANCIS: Lovely. I don't know about anyone else, but I'm touched.
CUNNINGHAM: We're just joking.
FRANCIS: No, no. It's okay. I encourage distractions. Wouldn't want you giving up on us, now would we?
DEADPOOL: Hey, don't take any shit from him, Cunningham. How tough can he be, with a name like Francis.
CUNNINGHAM: Francis?
DEADPOOL: That's his legal name. He got Ajax from the dish soap. F, R, A, N, C, I, oops! I snabbed the dry-cleaning tag off your lab coat. FYI, I could probably get you the super hero discount.
FRANCIS: You are so relentlessly annoying.
DEADPOOL: Thanks. Never heard that before.
FRANCIS: Why don't you do us all a favor and shut the fuck up? Or I'll sow your pretty mouth shut.
DEADPOOL: Oh, I wouldn't do that if I were you. See, here's the problem with round-the-clock torture. You can't really step it up from there.
FRANCIS: Is that what you think?
FRANCIS: If this doesn't unlock your mutation, well... Nothing will. Now, what we're going to do is lower the oxygen concentration in there to the exact point you feel like you're suffocating. If your brain waves slow, meaning you're about to pass out, then we'll turn up the O2. If your heart rate slows, meaning you're able to catch your breath, we'll turn it back down. And that's where we'll leave you. Right there.
DEADPOOL: Ugh, I thought you guys were dicks before.
FRANCIS: You know the funniest part of all this? You still think we're making you a super hero. You, a dishonorable discharge hook deep in hookers? You're nothing. Our secret, mate, is that this workshop doesn't make super heroes. We make super slaves. We're gonna fit you with a control collar and auction you off to the highest bidder. Who knows what they'll have you do. Terrorizing citizens, putting down freedom fighters. Maybe just mow the occasional lawn.
DEADPOOL: What the fuck is wrong with you?
FRANCIS: You're never going home after this. now there's a brave face.
DEADPOOL: Wait, wait! Seriously, you actually have something in your teeth now.
FRANCIS: Enjoy your weekend.
DEADPOOL: Weekend? Back up, weekend?
DEADPOOL:  Did I say this was a love story? No, it's a horror movie.
FRANCIS: Fucking hell. Looks like someone lost his shot at homecoming king.
DEADPOOL: What have you done to me?
FRANCIS: I've merely raised your stress levels high enough to trigger a mutation.
DEADPOOL: You sadistic fuck!
FRANCIS: I've cured you, Wade. Now your mutated cells can heal anything. It's attacking your cancer as fast as it can form. You know, I've seen some of the side effects before. I could cure them. But where's the fun in that? Now I'm gonna shut you in again Wade. Not because I need to. Because I want to. Ah, well. Go ahead.
ANGEL: You smell like shit.
ANGEL: Mother fucker -
FRANCIS: Hey, hey, hey! It's alright! It's alright. I think we owe him that, yeah? Take off. Go on, off you go. Quick question. What's my name? Didn't think so.
DEADPOOL:  Sorry, Francis, my lips are sealed.
FRANCIS: You don't wanna kill me! I'm the only one that can fix your barking mug!
FRANCIS: What's my name?
CUNNINGHAM: Wade...
DEADPOOL:  I didn't just get the cure to el cancer. I got the cure to el everything. But there was only one thing that really mattered.
DEADPOOL: No way. I'm not making her life as ugly as mine, man.
WEASEL: Oh, come on, Wade. It can't be that bad.
DEADPOOL: Ah, bullshit! I'm a monster inside and out. I belong in a fucking circus!
WEASEL: Wade, Vanessa loves you. She doesn't care what you - Oh. Oh.
DEADPOOL: Do you like what you see?
WEASEL: No. You look like an avocado had sex with an older, more disgusting avocado.
DEADPOOL: Yeah.
WEASEL: And not gently. Like, it was hate fucking. There was something wrong with the relationship, and that was the only catharsis they could find without violence.
DEADPOOL: And the only guy who can fix this fugly mug is the brown shitstick from the mutant factory, and he's gone! Poof.
WEASEL: Yeah, you've got to do something to remedy this, cause as of now you only have on course of action.
WEASEL: Damn straight. Find Francis -
WEASEL: Star in horror films.
DEADPOOL: What?
WEASEL: Star in your own horror films. Cause you look like Freddy Krueger face fucked a topographical map of Utah.
DEADPOOL: Here's what I'm actually going to do. I'm going to work through his crew until somebody gives up Francis, force him to fix this, put a bullet in his skull, and fuck the brain hole.
WEASEL: I don't want to see that or think of it again. But the douchebag does think you're dead, right?
DEADPOOL: Yeah.
WEASEL: That's good. You should keep it that way.
DEADPOOL: What, like, wear a mask?
WEASEL: Yes, a very thick mask, all the time. I am sorry, you are... haunting. Your face is the stuff of nightmares.
DEADPOOL: Like a testicle with teeth.
WEASEL: You will die alone. If, I mean, if you could die. Ideally. For others' sake.
DEADPOOL: That'll do.
WEASEL: All you need now is a suit and a nickname, like Wade the Wisecracker, or Scaredevil, Mr. Neverdie... Oh shit.
DEADPOOL: What?
WEASEL: I put all my money on you, and I just realized I'm never going to win the -
DEADPOOL: Deadpool. Captain Deadpool. No, just Deadpool. Yeah.
WEASEL: Yeah. To you, Mr. Pool. That sounds like a fucking franchise.
DEADPOOL: This shit's gonna have nuts in it.
AL: Seltzer water and lemon for blood. Or wear red. Dumbass.
DEADPOOL: Don't make me ask twice. Where's Francis?
DEADPOOL: He made me ask twice. Is it the mask?
DEADPOOL: You're about to be killed by a Zamboni!
DEADPOOL: Nice to see you, Jared. I'll take the footlong. Fully loaded.
DEADPOOL: 41 confirmed kills. Now it's 89. About to be 90.
MAN: Mr. Wilson?
DEADPOOL: Ding ding!
MAN: You're looking very... alive.
DEADPOOL: Ha! Only on the outside.
MAN: This isn't going to end well for me.
DEADPOOL: This is not gonna end well for you, no. Where's your boss?
MAN: I can tell you exactly -
DEADPOOL: Ah, da, da, da, da ,da ,da, da. Oh, you'll tell me. But first, you might want to look away for this.
DEADPOOL: Now this little piggy went to...
MAN: Ah!
DEADPOOL: Thank you, Agent Smith.
DOPINDER: Hop in!
DEADPOOL: And we all know how this turned out.
DEADPOOL: Whoops! You weren't meant to see that.
DEADPOOL: There. All caught up.
DEADPOOL: Sorry about bleeding in all of your garbage! Seltzer water and lemon for blood. Whoo! Some kinds of anger can't be managed. Like the kind where your year-long plan ends with the wrong guy getting dismembered! That said, when it comes time for licking wounds, there's no place like home. And I share that home with someone you've met. The old blind lady from the laundry mat, Al.
AL: God, I miss cocaine.
DEADPOOL: Her. Ah! Fourth wall break in a fourth wall break. That's like... sixteen walls! She's like Robin to my Batman, except she's old. And black. And blind. And I think she's in love with me. Wait, I'm pretty sure Robin loves Batman too.
DEADPOOL: Al?
DEADPOOL: Good morning, sleepy head. It smells like old lady pants in here.
AL: Yes, I'm old, I wear pants.
DEADPOOL: But you're no lady.
DEADPOOL: Oh! So comfy.
AL: Upside of being blind, I've never seen you in crocs.
DEADPOOL: You mean my big rubber masturbatin' shoes?
AL: Yes, I know. Downside of being blind. I hear everything in this duplex.
DEADPOOL: Sit on a stick.
AL: Bactine?
DEADPOOL: Yeah. Bactine should do it.
DEADPOOL: How's that Cunen coming along? IKEA doesn't assemble itself, you know.
AL: You're telling me. I don't mind the Cunen. It's an improvement on the Holdall.
DEADPOOL: Please. Anything's an improvement over the Holdall. I'd have taken and Emness or a Tristes over the Holdall. No, I didn't get excited until I saw the Cunen.
AL: Screw please.
DEADPOOL: Here? Now? Just kidding, I know it's been decades.
AL: You'd be surprised.
DEADPOOL: Pretty grossed out.
AL: Ta da.
AL: I wish I'd never heard of Craigslist.
DEADPOOL: And I quote, 'Looking for blind and likes imperfections, must be good with hands.' Or would you rather I build the ikea and you pay rent?
AL: Why so douchy this morning?
DEADPOOL: Let's recap. The cock-thistle that turned me into this freak slipped through my arms today. Arm. Catching him my only chance to be hot again, get my super sexy ex back, and prevent this shit from happening to someone else. So yeah, today was about as much fun as a sand paper dildo.
DEADPOOL: Hashtag drive by.
FRANCIS: Found out who our friend in the red suit is.
FRANCIS: Fucking Wade Wilson. Of course, I'd wear a mask too with a face like that. I only wish I healed the same. Still. We'll put him out of our misery. On our terms.
ANGEL: Right. And when he heals?
FRANCIS: He can't. Not if there's nothing left of him to heal. You know, it's funny. I almost missed the fucker. I like a challenge. But he's bad for business. Now let's go and find him.
AL: Tylenol PM?
DEADPOOL: I'd stick that where you stuck the Bactine. I raided my stash of wisdom teeth Percocet and I am orbiting fucking Saturn right now.
DEADPOOL: I appreciate the gesture.
AL: Am I crazy, or is your hand really small?
DEADPOOL: It's about the size of a KFC spork.
AL: I get why you're so pissy. But your mood's never going to right until you find this woman and tell her how you feel!
DEADPOOL: I keep telling you, Mrs. Magoo, she wouldn't have me! If you could see me, you'd understand.
AL: Looks aren't everything.
DEADPOOL: Looks are everything! You ever heard David Beckham speak? It's like he mouth-sexed a can of helium! You think Ryan Reynolds got this far on his superior acting method?
AL: Love is blind, Wade.
DEADPOOL: No. You're blind.
AL: So you're just gonna lie there and whimper?
DEADPOOL: No, I'm gonna wait till this arm plows through puberty, and then I'm gonna come up with a whole new Christmas Day plan. In the meantime, you might wanna leave the room. I bet it feels huge in this hand. Go, go, go, go, go ,go.
WEASEL: So the doctor says, 'Well the bad news is, you don't have that much time to live?' He says, 'How long do I have?' The doctor says, 'Five.' The guy says, 'Five what?' The doctor says, 'Four, three, two...'
WEASEL: Can I help you ladies?
FRANCIS: Well, I sure hope so. I heard you might be able to point me in the direction of a, um... A friend of mine. Name of Wade Wilson.
WEASEL: Sorry. I don't know the name.
WEASEL: Hey, you're not supposed to be behind the bar.
ANGEL: I recognize that girl.
FRANCIS: This must be Vanessa. I've heard so much about you.
WEASEL: Um, sweetheart, you might want to look around. This isn't really the place to do something like that.
FRANCIS: Easy, Angel. Put the little man down.
FRANCIS: We have everything we need now.
WEASEL: You sure? You don't want any clothes that aren't monochromatic? Have fun at your midnight showing of Blade 2.
WEASEL: Woo. Thanks for having my back, guys.
WEASEL: Wade, we have a fucking problem. And by we, I mean you.
DEADPOOL: I can't believe I'm doing this. Is there a word for half afraid, half angry?
WEASEL: Yeah, afrangry, I guess. Do you know what you're going to say to her?
DEADPOOL: Ugh, fuck me.
WEASEL: Uh, I'd maybe not start with that.
DJ: Hey, coming up on stage right now, give it up for Chastity!
WEASEL: Or, as I like to call her, irony.
DEADPOOL: We've got to find her fast, before numbnuts does.
WEASEL: How do you know she's in here?
DEADPOOL: Cause I'm constantly stalking the fox.
DEADPOOL:  Every time I see her, it's like the first time. Especially from this angle.
DJ: You can't find love, but you can rent it for three minutes!
DEADPOOL: You weak motherfucker! Come on. Come on, get it together. This isn't about me, this is about Vanessa. Here we go. Maximum effort.
MAN: Vanessa! Someone out back asking for you. Something about an old boyfriend.
VANESSA: I knew it was you. The weird curvy edges. Like a jigsaw puzzle.
FRANCIS: You have Wade Wilson to thank for this.
DEADPOOL: Hey, hey! Where'd she go?
WEASEL: I saw her head to the back. Go get her tiger.
DEADPOOL: Fuck... Mother fucker!
DEADPOOL: Chocolate! Jimminy! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Oh, I'm gonna rip this mother fucking -
DEADPOOL: Find that! Find that, I'm going to get angry!
WEASEL: Here, it says Vanessa. No, wait, it's Francis. He says he wants you to come to him.
DEADPOOL: What is that?
WEASEL: That's the shit emoji. You know, it's the turd with the smiling face and the eyes. I thought it was chocolate yogurt for so long.
DEADPOOL: I need guns.
WEASEL: Okay, which ones.
DEADPOOL: I need all the guns!
WEASEL: Alright.
WEASEL: That's about 3000 rounds.
DEADPOOL: Well, we all know what I can do with twelve.
WEASEL: Woah, woah, woah.
DEADPOOL: Careful with that, Ronnie Milsap. We're downrange.
AL: I was gonna spend the night assembling the Volgie, but this is holding my interest.
DEADPOOL: I told you, we're going with the Oordvash, not the Bjorsha, get it through your head or get outta fuck town!
AL: Shit. That's all the pieces in the house.
DEADPOOL: Na, na, na, na, na. Let's go, cough it up. Up, up, up, up, up.
DEADPOOL: Ugh, down, down, down.
AL: Fuck you.
WEASEL: Five cal. I like it. Wade. I'd go with you, but, I don't wanna.
DEADPOOL: Listen, Al. If I never see you again, I want you to know that I love you very much. Oh, and also, there's about 116 kilos of cocaine buried somewhere in the apartment, right next to the cure for blindness. Good luck.
WEASEL: Wanna get fucked up?
FRANCIS: Put her down over here.
FRANCIS: Go on then.
VANESSA: Thanks, dickless. And I mean you.
FRANCIS: Well. You're a talker too? You and Wade.
VANESSA: I've been trying to tell you assholes you've got the wrong girl. My old boyfriend, he's dead.
FRANCIS: See, I thought that too. But he keeps on coming back. Like a cockroach. Ugly. Now, I may not feel, but he does. Let's see how he fights with your head on the block.
DEADPOOL: Ripley! From Alien 3!
NEGASONIC: Fuck, you're old.
DEADPOOL: Ha! Fake laugh, hiding real pain. Go get silver balls.
NEGASONIC: You guys going for a bite? Early bird special?
DEADPOOL: Oh, like there's something wrong with eating before sundown or saving money. No, you know that bad guy that you let go? He's got my girl. You're gonna help me get her back.
COLOSSUS: Wade, is that you?
DEADPOOL: It's me, Deadpool, and I got an offer that you can't refuse! I'm gonna wait out here, okay? Big house. It's funny that we only ever see two of you. It's almost like the studio couldn't afford another x-man.
DEADPOOL: And that is why, in my opinion, the movie cocoon is pure pornography.
DOPINDER: Who brought this twinkly man?
DEADPOOL: Twinkly, but deadly. My chrome-penised friend back there has agreed to do me this solid. In exchange, I told him I would consider joining his boy band.
COLOSSUS: It's not boy band.
DEADPOOL: Sure it's not. Ah! So, any luck winning Gita back?
DOPINDER: I tried to Mr. Pool, but Bantu is more craftier and handsomer than me.
DEADPOOL: Well, I think you're pretty darn cute.
DEADPOOL: Dopinder.
DOPINDER: Hmm?
DEADPOOL: What was that?
DOPINDER: Uh, that was, uh... Bantu, in the trunk.
COLOSSUS: Ban-who?
DOPINDER: My romantic rival, Bantu. He's tied up in the trunk. I'm doing like you said, DP. I'm going to gut him like a tenduri fish, then put his carcass on Gita's doorstep.
NEGASONIC: He's super dead.
DOPINDER: Oh!
DOPINDER: I presume a crisp high five?
DEADPOOL: For you? Ten! Okay guys, let's get out there and make a difference! .
DOPINDER: Knock 'em dead, pool boy!
DEADPOOL: Time to make the chimi fucking changas. Not often a dude ruins your face, wall stomps your sanity, grabs your future baby-momma, and personally sees to four of your five shittiest moments. Let's just say, it's beginning to look a lot like Christmas.
NEGASONIC: Hey, where's your duffel bag?
DOPINDER: Bantu?
DEADPOOL: God damn it! I'm gonna do this the old fashioned way. With two swords and maximum effort. Cue the music.
FRANCIS: Wade Wilson! What's my name?
DEADPOOL: Ooh, I'mma fucking spell it out for you.
FRANCIS: Go get some.
DEADPOOL: Superhero landing, she's gonna do a superhero landing, wait for it!
DEADPOOL: Woo! Superhero landing. You know, that's really hard on your knees. Totally impractical. They all do it. You're a lovely lady, but I'm saving myself for Francis. That's why I brought him.
COLOSSUS: I'd prefer not to hit a woman, so please, pla -
DEADPOOL: I mean... That's why I brought her?
DEADPOOL: Oh, no, finish your tweet. Just give us a second. There you go, hashtag it. Go get her tiger.
DEADPOOL: Oh, I so pity the dude who pressures her into prom sex.
ANGEL: Alright then. Fire!
DEADPOOL: Finish fucking her the fuck up!
COLOSSUS: Language, please!
DEADPOOL: Suck a cock!
DEADPOOL: Look away, child. Look away!
DEADPOOL: Wait! Wait!
DEADPOOL: Hey, you only work for that shit spackled muffin fart! So, I'mma give y'all a chance to lay down your firearms, in exchange for preferential, borderline gentle, possibly lover-like treatment.
DEADPOOL: Fine! Commando.
DEADPOOL: Bob?
BOB: Wade?
DEADPOOL: Oh, my God, I haven't seen you since -
BOB: Jacksonville. TGI Friday's.
DEADPOOL: TGI Friday's!
DEADPOOL: What the hell! Come here you.
DEADPOOL: How are the kids? Good? And Gale, she still fixing that tuna casserole? So good. Bad for the waistline if you know what I mean.
COLOSSUS: You are, uh... Very beautiful woman.
ANGEL: You are so sweet! Thanks.
FRANCIS: Does he write you notes too? He's such a romantic.
DEADPOOL: Don't worry, baby. I'm coming.
FRANCIS: Fire!
NEGASONIC: Hey! Climb on.
DEADPOOL: Motherfucker should have worn his brown pants. You're right, beautiful! Red really is my color.
VANESSA: Wade?
DEADPOOL: Don't worry, baby. I'm gonna get you out of that shitbox.
FRANCIS: What better way to get inside that head of yours.
DEADPOOL: Oh, you never left.
VANESSA: But you did, asshole!
FRANCIS: Ah, take a deep breath darling. Oh wait, wrong choice of words.
DEADPOOL: I hope they've blocked pain to your every last nerve, cause I'mma go looking!
FRANCIS: You grow back body parts now, Wade? When I'm finished, parts'll have to grow back you.
DEADPOOL: Good one. Yeah, that was a good one. Let's dance. And by dance, I mean let's try to kill each other.
FRANCIS: Fine, fists.
DEADPOOL: Sounds like your last Saturday night.
VANESSA: Wade!
DEADPOOL: I got you, baby. I got a plan, but you're not gonna like it.
DEADPOOL: Don't worry, I'm totally on top of this.
DEADPOOL: Damn it! Maximum effort!
COLOSSUS: Just take it slow.
DEADPOOL: Yoo-hoo! Oh, my God, that was so awe -
DEADPOOL: There are no words... Me and you... Are headed to fix this butterface.
FRANCIS: What? You stupid fucking idiot. Did you really think there was a cure for that?
DEADPOOL: What?
FRANCIS: You heard me.
DEADPOOL: No, no! So you mean to say, after all this, you cant fix me.
FRANCIS: It sounds a bit stupider when you say it
DEADPOOL: Like the kind of stupid who admits he can't do the one thing I'm keeping him alive for?
DEADPOOL: Any last words?
FRANCIS: What's my name?
DEADPOOL: Who fucking cares?
COLOSSUS: Wade! Four or five moments.
DEADPOOL: I'm sorry?
COLOSSUS: Four or five moments. That's all it takes.
DEADPOOL: To...?
COLOSSUS: Be a hero. Everyone thinks it's a full-time job. Wake up a hero, brush your teeth a hero, go to work a hero. Not true! Over a lifetime, there are only four or five moments that really matter. Moments when you're offered a choice. To make a sacrifice, conquer a flaw, save a friend. Spare an enemy. In these moments, everything else falls away. The way the world sees us, the way we -
COLOSSUS: Why?
DEADPOOL: You were droning on! Sure, I may be stuck looking like pepperoni flatbread, but at least fuckface won't heal from that. If wearing superhero tights means sparing psychopaths, then maybe I wasn't meant to wear 'em. Not everyone monitors a hall like you.
COLOSSUS: Just promise -
DEADPOOL: Yeah, yeah, I'll be on the lookout for the next four moments. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm just a boy about to stand in front of a girl. And tell her... What the fuck am I going to tell her?
COLOSSUS: Well, heh, you better figure it out.
DEADPOOL: I can't even tell you -
DEADPOOL: I deserve that.
DEADPOOL: That too.
DEADPOOL: No, no, no, no, maybe not the nethers.
VANESSA: Start talking!
DEADPOOL: I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. For everything. I'm sorry for leaving, I'm sorry for not cowboying up sooner. It's been a rough couple of years.
VANESSA: Rough?
DEADPOOL: I live in a crack house. With a family of 12. Every night we spoon for warmth. Everyone fights for Noelle, she's the fattest. There's nothing that we don't share. Floorspace, dental floss, even condoms.
VANESSA: So you live in a house?
DEADPOOL: I should have come and found you sooner. But baby, the guy under this mask, he ain't the same one you remember.
VANESSA: You mean this mask?
DEADPOOL: And this one.
DEADPOOL: And this one. In case the other fell off. Just, yeah, ow, like a bandaid, just give it a good - Audi 5000! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Are you sure?
VANESSA: I'm sure.
VANESSA: Wow.
DEADPOOL: Yeah.
VANESSA: Hey, after a brief adjustment period, and a bunch of drinks, it's a face I'd be happy to sit on.
DEADPOOL: I'm not the same underneath this suit either. Super penis.
COLOSSUS: Come on Wade, language. Young one is present.
DEADPOOL: What are... What are you still doing here? Get out of here, go make yourself useful! You, go be a really big brother to someone. Tell Beast to stop shitting on my lawn. And you, chicken noodle, nothing compares to you. Sinead O'Connor, 1990.
NEGASONIC: That's alright. You're cool.
DEADPOOL: What in the ass! That was not mean! I'm proud of you.
COLOSSUS: We will make an x-man of you yet, Wade.
DEADPOOL: You know, for a second there, it felt like we were three mini lion robots coming together to form one super robot.
NEGASONIC: There's the stupid.
DEADPOOL: Yeah. And now, for the moment I've all been waiting for.
VANESSA: Come here.
DEADPOOL: Wham! As promised.
DEADPOOL:  See? You don't need to be a superhero to get the girl. The right girl will bring out the hero in you. Now, let's finish this epic wide shot, pull out, there we go, looks nice, it's gonna be the only thing pulling out tonight. Who doesn't love a happy ending? Till next time, this is your friendly neighborhood pool guy, saying, I'm never gonna dance again, the way I dance with you...
