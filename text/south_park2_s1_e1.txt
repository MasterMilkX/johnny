WENDY: Well, why don't you go get the fat kid?
KYLE: Why?
WENDY: Well if the fat kid has something implanted in his ass, maybe the visitors are using him as part of their plan. You should use the fat kid as bait to bring them back.
KYLE: Hey, you're right Wendy! C'mon Stan, We have to go get Cartman!
